# 9gag-post-filter

It seems like the devs keep breaking their own app, letting bots and spammers run around unchecked, and refuse to give the community what it wants. I want to try to fix that.

##   what is it?
It's a chrome\firefox extension (that also works on android), that lets you filter posts on 9gag in a way that the devs refuse to implement. 

## Features

- Brought back the downvote count
- Mark spammer accounts
- Show days next to the username on every post
- Hide users with less than X amount of days
- Hide anonymous 9GAGGER posts
- Hide users with blue checkmarks
- Hide 'Promoted' posts
- Hide posts by tags or words in the title

## How to install
Chrome: [Download on the Chrome webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/9gag-post-filter/ajkipkkhchaaccpbpkclolpebkgbmodl)\
Firefox: [Download on the Firefox addons website](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/9gag-post-filter/)
\
\
For Android:\
Kiwi Browser (Chromium browser with extension support): [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kiwibrowser.browser)
\
Firefox Nightly Android*: [short guide](https://youtu.be/cknXID7rV7k)
\
\
*Works but is buggier and less convenient than Kiwi IMO, but use whatever you want


## Plans for the future (maybe idk)
- move to a system based on interecepting network requests
- Add dark mode to the popup
- Make popup look nicer
- Buy milk


## Feedback
