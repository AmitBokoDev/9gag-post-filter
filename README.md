I started a full time job so updated are gonna be rare, but I am working on a small update to bring back the downvote button and make the code more efficient.


# 9gag-post-filter

Recently it has become apparant that 9gag is plagued by bots and spammers, so I created this simple extention to remove them from our feeds.\
This extention doesn't block any account but simply hides the posts.

## Installation
Chrome: [Download on the Chrome webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/9gag-post-filter/ajkipkkhchaaccpbpkclolpebkgbmodl)\
Firefox: [Download on the Firefox addons website](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/9gag-post-filter/)
\
\
For Android:\
Kiwi Browser (Chromium browser with extension support): [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kiwibrowser.browser)
\
Firefox Nightly Android*: [short guide](https://youtu.be/cknXID7rV7k)
\
\
*Works but is buggier and less convenient than Kiwi IMO, but use whatever you want



## Features

- Show days next to the username on every post
- Hide users with less than X amount of days
- Hide anonymous 9GAGGER posts
- Hide users with blue checkmarks
- Hide 'Promoted' posts
- Hide posts by tags or words in the title



## Soon (maybe idk)
- sus accounts list****
- Dark mode
- nice UI

**** with every accout age check, the code also pulls basic info about the last 10 posts that were posted by the user,\
     by checking if the user posts too frequently, we could mark that user as a possible bot or spammer.


## Feedback

Feel free to suggest any changes or improvements to my code
